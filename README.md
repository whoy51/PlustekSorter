# PlustekSorter


This is a short program I made to sort slides that I scanned using a plustek ephoto. Realistically, this program should work with any scanning machine. 

The program is made for front-and-back scanned photos so that the photos can be easily correlated to each other. It renames the photos and creates a combined version which displays both the front and back of the scanned photo in one jpeg.

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

This program will need modification to work on your specific project, but default usage can be done by just doing ``python renamefiles.py``. A simple GUI will pop up where you can select the directory of the scanned photos and then start the sorting process.
